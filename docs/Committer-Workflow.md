# Dojo Committer Workflow

## Contributing as a Committer

This is documented in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) which provides the contribution guidelines for Dojo as well as a well defined workflow for submitting Pull Requests to the repositories.

As a committer, you should use the contribution workflow for landing non-trival changes in areas which you are not directly responsible for, or you want/need to have a level of peer review prior to the change being merged.

If you prefer the command line, there are several tools which can issue pull requests from the command line. The most feature rich is [hub](https://hub.github.com/) which also provides many other features that make command line integration with GitHub easier.

Also, since generally you want to be rebasing to avoid merge commits, you may want to set it so that `git pull` is always a rebase pull:

```sh
$ git config --global --bool pull.rebase true
```

What this will do though is make git complain when you have unstaged changes. You will have to commit or stash them before you can do a `git pull` then.

### Branching

As a committer, you can use your own fork of a repository to issue your pull requests, or create a feature or issue branch off of master for your work in progress and issuing a Pull Request.  It is recommend that committers create a branch on the main repo, as it makes it easier to collaborate with other team members.

You should either name your branch in the format of `feature-{issue-number}-{description}` or `issue-{issue-number}-{description}`.  With the issue number relating to the GitHub issue number for the branch and description being a short description.  For example:

```
issue-108-fix-defect
feature-90-refactor-code
```

## Accepting a Pull Request

### Reviewing

Use the review tools that are now part of GitHub.  There are issues if we enforce the protection on the `master` branch
with being able to do releases of packages, so we cannot enforce via GitHub that approved reviews occur before squashing
and merging the PR.

A PR should have at least one approved review (and no outstanding change requested reviews) before merging.  Also, the other
checks (like CI passing, CLA's checked, and code coverage maintained) should all be passed.

If unsure, when and how to merge, coordinate with the maintainer.

### Using GitHub

GitHub repositories should be configured to only allow *squash and merge* for landing pull requests. This is the preferred way of accepting a pull request. Please make sure the merge description is accurate and readable.

### Locally

The *squash and merge* approach is not always sufficient. Perhaps individual commits need to be retained or additional fixes need to be made. Just remember that generally all pull requests should be squashed into a single commit in a main branch.

#### Setting up a Branch with the Pull Request

If you do not yet have a local branch containing the pull request you can create one. Let's assume you are merging pull request #200 into `dojo-core` into `master`. You should ensure you have an up-to date master:

```sh
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
```

You should then create a branch for the PR.  You shouldn't push this branch to the remote repository, so the name is irrelevant, but it is good practice to keep them named logically:

```sh
$ git checkout -b pr-200
```

Next you should pull in the PR, supplying the contributors repository and branch (this information is available via the view *command line instructions* link on GitHub):

```sh
$ git pull https://github.com/someone/core.git some-fix
```

If the patch does not cleanly reply, you should use the `git mergetool` to resolve conflicts and then commit the results.

#### Final Review

Now is your opportunity to review the Pull Request.  Even though Travis CI should have validated the PR and Codecov.io commented on the coverage changes, you are the last step for it getting merged, especially when we are merging something that might have had conflicts.

At a very least, you should run, to perform a development build and test against node:

```sh
$ grunt test
$ grunt dist
```

#### Manual *squash and Merge*

Checkout `master`:

```sh
$ git checkout master
```

And squash merge the commits:

```sh
$ git merge --squash pr-200
```

Now the commits will be staged as a single commit.  You may want to do one last `git status` to make sure you are ready to go and then commit signing-off with the appropriate author:

```sh
$ git commit --author "Someone <someone@example.com>"
```

You will need the appropriate e-mail address for the author.  If you are not sure of the e-mail address, `git log` can provide you with the information:

```sh
$ git log pr-200
commit 2c5e83668d8cfab0da61d3688874b0dc2e513956
Author: Someone <someone@example.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 1 08:00:00 2016 +0000

    Some wonderful PR!
```

We need to write our commit message then.  We should have a clear single line description of the commit, followed by a blank line and more details as well as referencing any issues or PRs we need to mention.  For example, if PR #200 also fixed issue #190, we would write something like this:

```
Fixed some sort of code in module (#200)

* Updated the tests
* Made a change

Closes #200
Fixes #190
```

Also, if for some reason we don't want to run the CI for this commit, don't forget to add `[ci skip]` to the body of the commit message.

You should now be ready to push:

```sh
$ git push
```

#### Fast-forward only Merges

If you want to retain individual commits you can perform a *fast-forward only* merge.

First checkout `master`:

```sh
$ git checkout master
```

Then merge the commits:

```sh
$ git merge --ff-only pr-200
```

This will fail if a *fast-forward only* merge is not possible. In that case checkout your local branch and rebase it against master, then try again:

```sh
$ git checkout pr-200
$ git rebase master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --ff-only pr-200
```

You should now be ready to push:

```sh
$ git push
```
## Importing Local Packages

Read about [working with packages](./Developing-with-Packages.md) to streamline your local development.

## Publishing a Package on npm

To publish a package, you should ensure you have a current checked out `master` branch.  The `package.json`
in master should have the version set at `X.X.X-pre`.  If it doesn't, ðŸ˜± and ðŸ”¥ and find out what is
wrong.

Validate the version of the package you are going to publish, by ensuring you are planning the right
tag and the right right version on npm:

```
$ git tag
2.0.0-alpha.3
2.0.0-alpha.4
2.0.0-alpha.5
2.0.0-alpha.6
2.0.0-alpha.7
2.0.0-beta.1
2.0.0-beta.2
2.0.0-rc.1
2.0.0
2.0.1

$ npm view
```

If for example, you are doing the point release of `2.1.1`, the `package.json` should contain `2.1.1-pre` and you will be changing this to `2.1.1`, and post the publish, you will set it to `2.1.2-pre`.  If you are doing a non-point release, for example the next *beta* release.  The `package.json` would still contain `2.1.1-pre` and you will change it to `2.1.1-beta.1` and then change it back to `2.1.1-pre`.  The `-pre` are **never** published to npm.

By convention, the non-point release tags we use are `-alpha.X`, `-beta.X` and `-rc.X`.  Note that once you reach a double digit, the sorting of these starts to break down, but it should have no impact on the semver resolution.

The tag you are going to create should match the semver version of the package on npm exactly.  For example, if
you are setting the version in the `package.json` to `"version": "2.0.0-beta.12"` the tag command should be
`git tag 2.0.0-beta.12`.

The only change that should be part of a release commit is the update to the `package.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "2.1.0"
}
```

Commit this change with a release comment similar to:

```
$ git commit -a -m "Release 2.1.0"
```

Then tag the release:

```
$ git tag 2.1.0
```

Publish to npm:

```
$ npm publish
```

Then update the `package.json` one more time:

```json
{
    "version": "2.1.1-pre"
}
```

Then commit this change:

```
$ git commit -a -m "Update package metadata"
```

Then push the changes upstream:

```
$ git push && git push --tags
```

## Versioning

Dojo follows semantic versioning (Breaking changes occur with major releases, e.g. 3.0.0, enhancements occur with either major releases or minor releases, e.g. 3.1.0, and patch releases are limited to bug fixes, e.g. 3.1.1).

Because Dojo is distributed as many packages, major versions will be synced. E.g. all packages for 2.x will start with a 2.0.0 release. Packages will individually release updates to their minor and patch releases, but when we are ready for a new major release, all packages will be released with a new major version number. Packages that are added will start with the current major version number for their initial release.

# Version 6.0.0 Migration Guide

Dojo version 6 contains several major ergonomic changes along with a few breaking changes to be aware of when migrating from version 5. As much as possible, these updates are automated by using the `@dojo/cli-upgrade-app` CLI command. When the upgrade command cannot automate the upgrade, helpful hints and information are provided in the output to guide you through the manual upgrade process for these changes.

To install the upgrade command, run the following from the project root:

```
npm install @dojo/cli-upgrade-app --no-save
```

To perform the migration, run the following command from the project root. The Dojo migration tool should automatically detect the necessary migration from your `package.json`.

```
dojo upgrade app
```

If you are upgrading from a version before 5.0.0, please first see the [previous migration guides](./V5-Migration-Guide) for more details.

-   The `@dojo/cli` should be updated to version 6.0.0, along with all the commands used by the project.
-   If your project is using `@dojo/widgets` and `@dojo/interop`, these packages also require upgrading to version 6.0.0.

**Note:** The migration tool may create line lengths that violate your projects linting rules, be sure to run your linter and manually fix any linting rule violations.

### Breaking Changes:

#### [Update to the new minimum TypeScript version supported by Dojo version 6](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/331)

As part of the improvements made for Dojo version 6, the minimum version of TypeScript has changed to `3.4.5`. This change is necessary to support the typings required by the new functional widgets and middleware.

Dojo version 6 should be fully compatible with `3.4.5` and newer. Updating a project's dependency should satisfy Dojo, however you may find changes are required in your project code to meet TypeScript additional checking added in newer versions.

In addition to upgrading TypeScript, the complementary library `tslib` should be upgraded to `~1.9.1`.

#### [`has`](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/361) and [`widget-core`](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/306) merged with `core`

As part of Dojo version 6 we have continued to re-organize `@dojo/framework`'s module structure. As a result, `@dojo/framework/widget-core` and `@dojo/framework/has` have been merged with `@dojo/framework/core`.

The `@dojo/cli-upgrade-app` command should automatically migrate your project's imports. Please let us know if you encounter any issues.

#### [`@dojo/framework/widget-core/d` and `@dojo/framework/widget-core/tsx` moved to `@dojo/framework/core/vdom`](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/360)

In addition to merging `widget-core` with `core`, the `d` and `tsx` exports have been moved into `vdom`.

**Note:** There is one exception, `decorate` has been moved from `d` to `util`.

The `@dojo/cli-upgrade-app` command should automatically migrate your project's imports. please let us know if you encounter any issues.

#### [`WNode` are no longer decorated with `bind`](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/290)

In previous versions of Dojo, virtual DOM nodes created by widgets get decorated with additional metadata such as `bind`. These extra properties were never meant to get exposed to the end user. However, as this metadata was added by mutating the `DNodes`, they were inadvertently exposed. As of Dojo version 6, we no longer mutate `DNodes` to ensure that this implementation detail of the framework is not exposed to the end user.

We don't envisage this change affecting many projects, however, if it does please raise an issue with your use case so we can investigate an officially supported mechanism.

#### [AssertionTemplate `replace` renamed to `replaceChildren`](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/412)

The `replace` method has been renamed to `replaceChildren` with the introduction of a new API for `replace` that will replace a single node of an assertion template and not target just the children.

Additionally we have deprecated passing an array of `DNode` to APIs that replace/modify children in favor of a factory function to ensure that the `DNode` are immutable. The existing API is still supported, but you will receive a warning and we recommend changing to use a function as the array API is likely to be removed in a future Dojo release.

```ts
const base = assertionTemplate(() => {
	return v('div', { key: 'div' }, [v('div')]);
});

// existing API
base.setChildren('@div', [v('span')]);

// recommended API
base.setChildren('@div', () => [v('span')]);
```

#### [Router no longer uses extends `QueueingEvented`](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/402)

In Dojo 6, the Dojo router has changed from extending the `QueueingEvented` as a way to enable users to subscribe to events that occur when the router started automatically. Instead an extra option is available, `autostart` which can be used to control when the router actually starts up. This is defaulted to `true` as this is the most common use case. For scenarios where the initial routing events need to be captured, `autostart` can be set to `false` and then `.start()` explicitly called on the router instance.

```ts
import Registry from '@dojo/framework/core/Registry';
import { registerRouterInjector } from '@dojo/framework/routing/RouterInjector';
import routes from './routes.ts';

const registry = new Registry();
const router = registerRouterInjector(routes, registry, { autostart: false });

// wire up to any router events
router.on('nav', () => {
	// do something on router nav, this will catch the initial routing event
});

router.start();
```

#### [`QueueingEvented` has been removed](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/402)

The `QueueingEvented` module has been removed from Dojo, this was only ever intended to be used internally and not something that we recommend using externally.

#### [Transition strategy not automatically imported](https://github.com/dojo/framework/pull/418)

The transition strategy for the virtual DOM renderer is no longer implicitly imported in `vdom`. To use `VNode` transitions that leverage `exitAnimation` or `enterAnimation`, the transition strategy needs to get explicitly imported and passed to the applications `.mount` call.

```ts
import renderer, { w } from '@dojo/framework/core/vdom';
import transition from '@dojo/framework/core/animations/cssTransitions';

const r = renderer(() => w(App, {}));
r.mount({ transition });
```

## Widget changes

Work has begun on adding `helperText` and a consistent validation approach to `@dojo/widgets`.

One of the knock-on effects of adding `helperText` is that `labelAfter` no longer makes sense as it would clash with the `helperText`; as such, all labels will appear before / above the widget they belong to. If you with to place the label elsewhere, you can do so by manually creating one and using the `for` property to link it to your input.

The change from passing `invalid` to `valid` was both to remove the frequent use of negatives in widgets and to align better with the `onValidate` callback naming.

Finally, we have started writing our new widgets in TSX. We may convert existing widgets over to use TSX in future if we make any extensive changes to them.

### TextInput

#### Removed Properties

-   `invalid`
-   `labelAfter`

#### New Properties

-   `customValidator?: (value: string) => { valid?: boolean; message?: string; } | void;`
-   `onValidate?: (valid: boolean | undefined, message: string) => void;`
-   `valid?: boolean | { valid: boolean; message: string; }`
-   `leading?: () => DNode;`

### Enhanced Text Input

This widget has been removed in favour of the new `leading` / `trailing` properties on `@dojo/text-input`. We plan to adopt this approach for other widgets such as `select` / `combobox` etc in future.

To create a text-input with a leading dollar sign for example:

```tsx
<TextInput leading={() => <span>$</span>} />

### Card

This new widget is a styled wrapper for app content similar to the material-design card. The widget takes `children` to render and an `actiondRenderer` function to ensure action buttons are placed in the correct location.
Card widget users should import it's css module to use it's classes to lay out it's content. For more information and examples of this, please see the card widget readme: https://github.com/dojo/widgets/blob/master/src/card/README.md.

#### Properties

-   `actionsRenderer?: () => RenderResult` - An Actions portion for the card, used primarily to render buttons

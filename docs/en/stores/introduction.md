# Introduction

Dojo stores provide a predictable, consistent state container with built-in support for common state management patterns.

This Dojo stores package provides a centralized store designed to be the single source of truth for an application. Dojo applications operate using uni-directional data flow. As a result, all application data follows the same lifecycle, ensuring the application logic is predictable and easy to understand.

# Introduction

As an HTML-based technology, Dojo makes use of CSS for styling elements across the framework and for applications developed with it.

Dojo promotes encapsulated structural styling of individual widgets for maximum reuse, as well as simplified presentational theming across all widgets within an application. This pattern gives users a predictable way to style and theme their applications, even when using a mixture of widgets from [Dojo's `@dojo/widgets` library](https://github.com/dojo/widgets), a third-party provider, or any that may be developed in-house for a particular application.

| Feature                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Per-widget stylesheets                | [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) can be used to define stylesheets that are scoped to individual widgets, avoiding potential cross-contamination and style name clashes. A widget can refer to its exact CSS class names via typed CSS module imports and IDE autocompletion.                                                                                                 |
| Robust theming support                | Themeable widgets can easily be developed that allow for simplified and centralized whole-application theming, as well as single-instance, targeted style tweaking and overriding, if required. [CLI tooling is available](https://github.com/dojo/cli-build-theme) to support distributing custom themes.                                                                                             |
| Reactive theme change response        | Similar to other reactive state changes within a Dojo application, only the affected widgets will be re-rendered when a theme change is made at either a widget level or across an entire application.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Abstracted CSS properties             | Individual CSS modules can refer to a set of centrally-defined `:root` style variables through [CSS custom properties and `var()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Simplified third-party widget theming | Applications can easily extend their themes to cover third-party widgets, such as those from Dojo's native [widget library](https://github.com/dojo/widgets), and Dojo also provides [out-the-box themes](https://github.com/dojo/themes) which applications can base their own on. [CLI tooling is available](https://github.com/dojo/cli-create-theme) to streamline theme creation and composition. |

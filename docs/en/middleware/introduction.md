# Introduction

Dojo's middleware system provides a way to manage asynchronous or imperative APIs in a reactive way, as well as influence behavior and the property API of any composing function-based widgets or other middleware.

Several core and optional middleware are provided by the framework, however, application developers can easily write their own.

| Feature                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Reactive DOM access                        | Via middleware, function-based widgets can work with concrete information and APIs from the sections of the DOM corresponding to their output nodes.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Widget render lifecycle control            | Middleware can control the portions of Dojo's rendering pipeline for any composing widgets, such as invalidating widgets when they require a rendering update. Widget rendering can also be paused and resumed, allowing for short-circuiting of the render output while waiting for critical information to become available. |
| A variety of framework-provided middleware | Dojo provides optional middleware that allow widgets to implement a range of functionality such as responding to and controlling focus, simple value caching, responding to element intersection and resize events, CSS theming, internationalization and build-time rendering amongst others.                                 |
| Easy composition and re-use                | The middleware design is closely aligned with function-based widgets, allowing consistent composition within a widget hierarchy as well as re-use when developing custom middleware.                                                                                                                                           |

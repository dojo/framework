# Deploying

The following guide(s) are based on some shared assumptions:

- You are using the default build output location (`output/dist`);
- Dojo is installed as a local dependency in your project, and you have setup the following npm scripts:

``` json
{
  "scripts": {
     "build": "dojo build --mode dist"
  }
}

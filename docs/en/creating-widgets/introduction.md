# widget-core

widget-core is a library to create powerful, composable user interface widgets.

-   **Reactive & unidirectional:** widget-core follows core reactive principles to ensure predictable, consistent behavior.
-   **Encapsulated Widgets:** Create independent encapsulated widgets that can be wired together to create complex and beautiful user interfaces.
-   **DOM Abstractions:** widget-core provides API abstractions to avoid needing to access or manipulate the DOM outside of the reactive render life-cycle.
-   **I18n & Themes:** widget-core provides core mixins to enable internationalization and theming support for your widgets.

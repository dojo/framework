# Introduction

Dojos Routing package provides a first class declarative routing solution for your application. Widgets are the fundamental concept in Dojo applications and with routing it is no different. Dojo Routing provides a collection of widgets that integrate directly within your Dojo application. They enable widgets to be associated with routes without compromising their functionality, reusability or property interface.
